# URLFuzzer

Fuzz testing or fuzzing is an automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects
and vulnerabilities. A fuzzing tool injects these inputs into the system and then monitors for exceptions such as crashes or information leakage.

Our URL Fuzzer is a black box software testing technique that allows user to input a website, it runs some vulnerable inputs to capture the vulnerabilities 
and crashes in the website. It also tries to inject some random SQL Quaries to observe the changes. If the Fuzzer detects any vulnerability, it shows it to the user.
